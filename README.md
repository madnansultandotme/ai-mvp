# AI Image Generator MVP

This is a simple AI Image Generator MVP built with Next.js. It allows users to input prompts, such as "boat with sunset view" or "a boy sitting on car back," and generates images that correspond to the given prompt from a set of predefined images. The project uses the `public` directory to serve images locally.

## Features
- Input prompts and see corresponding images generated based on predefined matches.
- Simple UI with a prompt input field and a button to generate images.
- Images are displayed from the `public` directory based on the userâ€™s input.
